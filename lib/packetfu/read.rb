module PacketFu

	# The Read class facilitates reading from libpcap files, which is the native file format
	# for packet capture utilities such as tcpdump, Wireshark, and PacketFu::PcapFile.
	#
	# This class requires PcapRub to be loaded (for now).
	#
	# == Example
	#
	#   pkt_array = PacketFu::Read.f2a(:file => 'pcaps/my_capture.pcap')
	#
	# === file_to_array() Arguments
	#
	#   :filename | :file | :out
	#     The file to read from.
	#
	#   :keep_timestamps | :keep_ts | :ts
	#     If set to true, the original timestamps are preserved.
	#

		# when those methods are called without first instantiating. (I like
		# tab completion a lot). The alias_methods make sure they show up
		# as instance methods, but but when you call them, you're really 
		# calling the class methods. Tricksy!
